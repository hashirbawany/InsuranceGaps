# Flood Risk and Insurance Gap Mapping

_Automated GIS Analysis and Cartographic Layouts_

## Overview

This project automates the creation of publication ready geospatial maps analyzing **flood risk and insurance gaps in Harris County, Texas** using ArcGIS Pro and Python. The workflow integrates spatial data processing, map symbology, and layout generation into a fully scripted and reproducible GIS pipeline.

Instead of relying on manual GIS operations, the project programmatically constructs maps and layouts to ensure consistency, transparency, and scalability across analyses.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated

- Programmatic interaction with **ArcGIS Pro** via Python (ArcPy)
- Automated creation of thematic maps using:
  - Categorical rendering for risk classifications
  - Natural Breaks (Jenks) classification for continuous variables
- Dynamic control of map symbology and color ramps
- End to end **layout automation**, including:
  - Map frames
  - Legends with custom formatting
  - Scale bars and north arrows
  - Precisely positioned titles and text elements
- Direct manipulation of ArcGIS Pro’s **Cartographic Information Model (CIM)** for fine grained control beyond standard ArcPy functionality
- Reproducible geospatial workflows suitable for academic research and policy analysis
